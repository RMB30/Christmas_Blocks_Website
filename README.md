# Christmas_Blocks_Website
A website where users can create profiles and try to beat others' high scores.  
All profile information is stored in a MYSQL database.
The website links to a Unity game I made and uploaded to a 3rd-party website called simmer.io. 
This website was created using code from Python, HTML, C#, CSS, and MYSQL.
